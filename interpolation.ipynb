    "# Interpolation Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpolation is a method of estimating unknown values that fall between known values in data. Various interpolation techniques exist, each with its own set of applications and characteristics. Let's explore the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Interpolation by a Single Polynomial\n",
    "A general form for a single polynomial interpolation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \\cdots + a_n x^n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $P(x)$ is the interpolated polynomial, and $a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_n$ are the coefficients determined by the known data points. The degree of the polynomial $n$ depends on the number of points to be interpolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application:\n",
    "Given data points, we can fit a polynomial of degree $n-1$ through those points. For example, with three data points, we would fit a quadratic polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Lagrange Interpolation\n",
    "Lagrange interpolation finds the interpolating polynomial through the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} y_i \\cdot L_i(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $L_i(x)$ is the Lagrange basis polynomial given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L_i(x) = \\prod_{\\substack{0 \\leq j \\leq n \\\\ j \\neq i}} \\frac{x - x_j}{x_i - x_j}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the known data points, and the summation gives the interpolated value $P(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application:\n",
    "Lagrange interpolation is ideal for small datasets where you need to pass through every data point exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Chebyshev Interpolation\n",
    "Chebyshev interpolation is a method that uses Chebyshev polynomials, which minimize the interpolation error compared to equidistant points. The Chebyshev polynomial $T_n(x)$ of degree $n$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T_n(x) = \\cos(n \\cdot \\cos^{-1}(x))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application:\n",
    "Chebyshev interpolation is used for approximating functions, especially when minimizing oscillation between the data points is important, such as in function approximation and numerical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Piecewise Linear Interpolation\n",
    "In piecewise linear interpolation, the data points are connected with straight lines. The interpolation function between two consecutive points $(x_i, y_i)$ and $(x_{i+1}, y_{i+1})$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(x) = y_i + \\frac{(x - x_i)}{(x_{i+1} - x_i)}(y_{i+1} - y_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application:\n",
    "Piecewise linear interpolation is used in situations where a quick and simple interpolation is needed, such as in real-time simulations or when the function is approximately linear between points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Piecewise Cubic Interpolation (Cubic Spline)\n",
    "Cubic spline interpolation fits a piecewise cubic polynomial between each pair of data points, ensuring smoothness at the data points. The spline equation for each segment $i$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_i(x) = a_i x^3 + b_i x^2 + c_i x + d_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients $a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i$ are determined by solving a system of equations that enforce continuity and smoothness of the first and second derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application:\n",
    "Cubic splines are widely used in computer graphics and data smoothing, where the curve should be smooth and flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Newton Interpolation and Divide Differences\n",
    "Newton's method for interpolation is based on the concept of divided differences. The interpolating polynomial is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(x) = f[x_0] + (x - x_0)f[x_0, x_1] + (x - x_0)(x - x_1)f[x_0, x_1, x_2] + \\cdots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $f[x_0]$ is the function value at $x_0$, and the divided differences $f[x_0, x_1], f[x_0, x_1, x_2]$, etc., are recursively computed from the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application:\n",
    "Newton interpolation is efficient when adding new points to an existing dataset, as it allows for updating the interpolation polynomial without recalculating it from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Error in Polynomial Interpolation\n",
    "The error in polynomial interpolation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E(x) = \\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\\xi)}{(n+1)!} \\prod_{i=0}^{n} (x - x_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $f^{(n+1)}(\\xi)$ is the $(n+1)$-th derivative of the function evaluated at some point $\\xi$, and $x_i$ are the interpolation nodes. The error depends on the degree of the polynomial and the spacing of the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application:\n",
    "Understanding the error is crucial for selecting the appropriate interpolation method and for determining the potential accuracy of the interpolation for large datasets or higher-degree polynomials.\n"
